                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;― Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist</p>
                        <p>The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho continues to change the lives of its readers forever. With more than two million copies sold around the world, The Alchemist has established itself as a modern classic, universally admired.

                        Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the magical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure as extravagant as any ever found.
                    
                        The story of the treasures Santiago finds along the way teaches us, as only a few stories can, about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, above all, following our dreams.</p>

                            I won’t describe what I look like. Whatever you’re thinking, it’s probably worse.
                            August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. 
                            Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid—but his new classmates can’t get past Auggie’s extraordinary face.
                            Wonder, begins from Auggie’s point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others.

                            Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, 
                            Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis.
                            But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group,
                            Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten.
                            Insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw, The Fault in Our Stars is award-winning author John Green's 
                            most ambitious and heartbreaking work yet, brilliantly exploring the funny, thrilling, and tragic business of being alive and in love.

                        <p>
                            So often, it's the simplest acts of courage that touch the lives of others. 
                            Sudha Murty-through the exceptional work of the Infosys Foundation as well as through her own youth,
                            family life and travels-encounters many such stories... And she tells them here in her characteristically
                            clear-eyed, warm-hearted way. She talks candidly about the meaningful impact of her work in the devadasi
                            community, her trials and tribulations as the only female student in her engineering college and the
                            unexpected and inspiring consequences of her father's kindness. From the quiet joy of discovering the
                            reach of Indian cinema and the origins of Indian vegetables to the shallowness of judging others based 
                            on appearances, these are everyday struggles and victories, large and small. Unmasking both the beauty
                            and ugliness of human nature, each of the real-life stories in this collection is reflective of a life
                            lived with grace.
