                            3 Idiots is a 2009 Hindi-language Indian coming-of-age comedy-drama film written and
                            directed by Rajkumar Hirani and co-written by Abhijat Joshi, with producer Vidhu Vinod
                            Chopra acting as a screenplay associate. Adapted loosely from Chetan Bhagat's novel 
                            Five Point Someone, the film stars Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi in the titular
                            role, marking their reunion 3 years after the 2006 film Rang De Basanti, while Kareena Kapoor,
                            Boman Irani and Omi Vaidya star in the pivotal lead roles. Narrated through parallel dramas,
                            one in the present and the other ten years in the past, the story follows the friendship of
                            three students at an Indian engineering college and is a satire about the social pressures 
                            under an Indian education system.
